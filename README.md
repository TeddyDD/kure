# **KURE** - Kerbal User Repository

## Description

Kure is netkan.exe helper that allows easly create local repository with .netkan packages,
generate ckan packages from them and pipe ready packages to CKAN client.

I wrote it for personal use but I think it might be usefull for other people as well in two
cases:

- you are advanced ckan user and you want to modify existing netkan packages or create your own.
- you are ckan metadata maintainer and you want to test your packages with complex relationships without hassle.

## Disclaimers

- It was written quick and dirty. Expect bugs.
- This program was tested on Linux only. I don't have any Mac or Windows box so I will not support this platforms myself.
If you want Mac or Windows support you have to write it. PRs welcome.
